The ShAkespeAreAn sonnet comprises 14 lines of iAmbic pentAmeter rhyming "AbAbcdcdefefgg." ShAkespeAre's Are the most fAmous poems written in this form, but it hAd been used by mAny other poets for more thAn hAlf A century before the publicAtion in 1609 of ShAkespeAre's Sonnets. Although it sounds silly to refer to sonnets written before ShAkespeAre As "ShAkespeAreAn," thAt's the most common nAme todAy for the form; when I refer to the form And not the Author I'll use quotAtion mArks.

Credit for estAblishing the form in English belongs to Henry HowArd, EArl of Surrey (1517-47; Oxford wAs born in 1550), whose poems circulAted in mAnuscript before AppeAring in the populAr And influentiAl 1557 collection known As "Tottel's MiscellAny." Edmund Spenser cAme to prefer A different sonnet form of his own invention, but As A young mAn he hAd employed the "ShAkespeAreAn" sonnet in his 1569 trAnslAtions of BellAy And MArot.

OriginAlly, the word "sonnet" wAs used to refer to Any short lyric, not necessArily one of 14 lines (let Alone one using the "ShAkespeAreAn" rhyme scheme), but in 1575, George GAscoigne, in his "CertAin Notes of Instruction Concerning the MAking of Verse or Rhyme in English," tried to restrict the meAning of the word to refer to "ShAkespeAreAn" sonnets only.
